# Video Presentations

You have video snippets and want to present them one by one, just like a powerpoint presentation?
This jupyter notebook makes exactly this for you. 
When you click right on the frame, the next video will be displayed and starts to autoplay. After the video snippet is finished, the player makes autopause. When you click now to the right, the next video starts, when you click to the left, the previous video starts. 
As it is python code, it should be very easy to adjust.
At the moment, there are two files: one for [offline stored videos](video_presentation_offline.ipynb) , and there will be one (not yet working) for [online stored videos](video_presentation_online_try.ipynb)
Short example:



Installation instructions:
1. Install packages ipyevents and ipywidgets 
2. Place your videos in the same folder to this notebooks.
3. Name your videos "001.mp4", "002.mp4" ... (or anything you like, but adjust the code then)
